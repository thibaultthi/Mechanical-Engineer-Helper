1. Purpose

Provide a centralized platform offering mechanical engineering calculators (starting with beam deflection) and structured reference data (materials, formulas, and best practices).

2. Key Features
	1.	Beam Deflection Calculator
	•	Single-page tool to input beam parameters
	•	Immediate numeric results for deflection
	•	Optional expansions (multiple boundary conditions)
	2.	Reference Data
	•	Materials library (steel, aluminum, etc.) with properties
	•	Basic formulas (stress/strain, basic statics, etc.)
	3.	Search & Filters
	•	Search bar for quick formula or material lookups
	•	Filters by material type, property range, or formula category
	4.	Responsive UI
	•	Mobile-friendly layout
	•	Quick-load pages, minimal clutter
	5.	Scalable Architecture
	•	Ability to add more calculators (torsion, column buckling)
	•	Database-driven for materials, disclaimers, references
	6.	Future Roadmap (optional)
	•	User registration (save calculations, custom material sets)
	•	Community submission or advanced data sets
	•	Ad placements or sponsorship integration

3. User Roles
	1.	Guest Users
	•	Access all calculators and reference data
	•	No login required
	2.	Authenticated Users (future)
	•	Save personal calculations and notes
	•	Access advanced data or premium features

4. Success Metrics
	1.	Usage
	•	Number of daily visits to calculators
	•	Frequency of repeated usage
	2.	Data Engagement
	•	Click-throughs on reference tables
	•	Time spent on pages
	3.	Performance
	•	Load times below 2 seconds
	•	Calculator results in under 0.5 seconds
	4.	Expansion
	•	Positive user feedback leading to additional calculators
	•	Steady increase in materials database size

5. Constraints
	•	Must use Next.js/React for front end
	•	PostgreSQL database for structured data
	•	Deployed via Vercel or containerized environment
	•	Comply with data licensing (public domain, manufacturer permission, etc.)

6. Dependencies
	•	ORM (Prisma, Sequelize, or TypeORM)
	•	Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for styling
	•	Potential search library (ElasticSearch) if data grows
	•	Future integration with NextAuth or JWT-based auth

7. Timeline (Initial Milestones)
	1.	MVP Release
	•	Beam deflection calculator
	•	Core materials reference (e.g., 5–10 common metals)
	•	Basic responsive design
	2.	Phase 2
	•	Additional calculators (torsion, stress, etc.)
	•	Expanded materials database
	•	Basic search & filter features
	3.	Phase 3
	•	User accounts and saved data
	•	More extensive references, possible paid features

8. Approval

All stakeholders (development, design, content, potential domain experts) sign off on these requirements before proceeding with implementation.
