Backend Structure

Overview
	•	Next.js API Routes handle core server logic within the same repo as the front end
	•	ORM (e.g., Prisma or Sequelize) connects to a PostgreSQL database
	•	Shared Utility functions for calculations and data transformations

Folder & File Organization
	•	/pages/api/
	•	calculators/: endpoints for different calculators (e.g., /api/calculators/beam-deflection)
	•	materials/: endpoints for CRUD operations on materials data
	•	auth/ (future): authentication endpoints if user accounts are implemented
	•	/lib/ or /utils/
	•	db.ts (database connection, ORM setup)
	•	calculations.ts (server-side calculation logic)
	•	validation.ts (request payload validation, optional)

Database Integration
	•	Models:
	•	Material: (id, name, density, young_modulus, yield_strength, etc.)
	•	Calculator (optional): metadata for each calculator tool
	•	User (future): user profiles, saved calculations
	•	Queries:
	•	Simple CRUD for materials
	•	Possibly store user-submitted data in separate tables

Request Flow
	1.	Client Sends Request (e.g., /api/calculators/beam-deflection)
	2.	Validation & Parsing of query/body params in API route
	3.	Calculation or DB Query using utility functions or ORM methods
	4.	Response returned in JSON format

Security & Error Handling
	•	HTTP Status Codes: standard 200, 400, 404, 500, etc.
	•	Validation: ensure numeric fields are valid for calculator inputs
	•	Error Logging: log critical errors; optionally integrate with a service like Sentry
	•	Authentication (future): JWT or NextAuth for protected endpoints

Scalability
	•	Microservices (optional expansion): move heavy logic or data processing to a separate Node/Express service if needed
	•	Caching: consider in-memory or Redis caching for frequently requested data (e.g., common materials)
	•	Load Balancing: depends on traffic; Vercel or container orchestration can handle horizontal scaling

Summary
	•	Simple, centralized API routes in Next.js
	•	Relational data in PostgreSQL via ORM
	•	Clean, modular code to accommodate additional calculators or references without major refactoring
