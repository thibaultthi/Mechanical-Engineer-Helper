Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Foundations
	1.	Repository Setup
	•	Initialize a Next.js project (with TypeScript if desired).
	•	Set up version control (Git) with a main branch for production and feature branches.
	2.	Basic Folder Structure
	•	/pages/api/ for API routes
	•	/pages/calculators/ for calculator front-end pages
	•	/components/ for reusable UI elements
	•	/lib/ or /utils/ for calculation or DB utilities
	3.	Database & ORM
	•	Choose an ORM (Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM).
	•	Define initial schema: Material, optional Calculator table.
	•	Migrate to create tables in PostgreSQL (local or hosted instance).
	4.	Environment & Hosting
	•	Create a .env file with DB connection string.
	•	Deploy a test instance on Vercel for rapid iteration.

Phase 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
	1.	Beam Deflection Calculator
	•	Front-end page with input form (length, load, E, I, boundary conditions).
	•	API route /api/calculators/beam-deflection with calculation logic.
	•	Display result on the same page, handle errors gracefully.
	2.	Basic Materials Reference
	•	Seed the database with ~5–10 materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, etc.)
	•	Front-end page /materials listing each material’s properties.
	•	Simple database read via an API route /api/materials.
	3.	UI & Navigation
	•	Create a navbar with links to Home, Calculators, Materials.
	•	Style with Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for consistency.

Phase 3: Enhancements
	1.	Search & Filtering
	•	Add a search bar on the materials page.
	•	Implement query parameters (e.g., filter by density or name).
	2.	Multiple Calculators
	•	Add more calculators (e.g., Torsion, Column Buckling) following the same pattern.
	•	Use shared forms/components for consistency.
	3.	Disclaimers & References
	•	Add disclaimers on each calculator page.
	•	Reference table in the DB if needed, or static content.
	4.	Responsive & Performance Optimization
	•	Ensure mobile-friendly layouts, test on multiple devices.
	•	Monitor page load speed; optimize any large bundles.

Phase 4: User Features (Optional)
	1.	Authentication
	•	Implement NextAuth or JWT-based approach.
	•	Allow users to save calculations.
	2.	User Dashboard
	•	Show saved calculations, frequently used materials, etc.
	•	Provide customization (unit preferences, default materials).
	3.	Community or Extended Data
	•	User submission of new materials or formulas.
	•	Admin review workflow if needed.

Phase 5: Monitoring & Growth
	1.	Analytics
	•	Track usage of each calculator.
	•	Assess which materials are most viewed.
	2.	Logging & Error Tracking
	•	Integrate Sentry or similar to catch runtime errors.
	•	Watch for performance bottlenecks.
	3.	Scaling
	•	If traffic spikes, consider caching or microservice architecture.
	•	Potentially containerize the application for more flexible deployment.
